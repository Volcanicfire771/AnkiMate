Good luck!Units of Measurement
The units ofmeasurement are the units that are used to
represent physical quantities like length, mass, temperature,
current, area, volume, intensity, etc.

Time :
21Units of Measurement Conversion
Second ( s) 1 s = 1/60 min
Minute ( min) 1 min = 60 s
Hour ( hr) 1 hr = 60 min = 3600 s
Day 1 day = 24 hr
Week 1 week = 7 days
Month 1 month = 4 weeks
Year 1 year = 12 monthsUnits of Measurement
Length isaphysical quantity that gives themeasure ofhow long
anobject is.

Gallon ( gal) 1gal = 128 fl. oz.
Pint ( pt) 1 pt= 16 fl. oz.Units of Measurement
Temperature isaphysical quantity that describes how hot or
cold anobject ortheweather is.Wehave mainly three units of
measurement oftemperature, Celsius, Kelvin, and Fahrenheit .
25Units of Measurement Conversion
Celsius ( C) 0¬∞C = 273.15 K = 32¬∞F
Kelvin ( K) 0 K = -273. 15¬∞C = -459.57¬∞F
Fahrenheit ( F) 0¬∞F = -17.778¬∞C =255.372 KUnits of Measurement
Other quantities commonly used inchemistry, and which have
special names fortheunits derived from these basic units are:
